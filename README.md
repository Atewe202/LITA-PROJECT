  - Data Validation
    
  2.  Data Cleaning and Preparation
  Data can come in dirty form, it has to be cleaned before it can be used for analysis.
   - Data loading and ingestion
   - Handling missing values
   - Data cleaning and formating
  -  In the initial phase of the Data cleaning and preparation, we performed the following action;
  - Understanding functional argument:-mandatory and Optional Argument
  - How to change from one case to another UPPER, PROPER etc
  - Text Extraction by use of some functions e.g LEFT, RIGHT (when extracting text from the right part of the original text), MID, FIND SEARCH
  - =RIGHT(Text, LEN, FIND(Text)-FIND " ",Text), =RIGHT(B6,LEN(B6) FIND(" ",B6)
  - Use of VLOOKUP in nesting tables, VLOOKUP value is what is common in both tables. It could be Exact match or Approximate match
  - -Use of e function AND, OR
    
   3. Excel Analysis

### Experience: 
It has been a very engaging and impartfull exercise. Data anallytics is a skill I have always aspire to acquire.
- Coming from a background with almost zero knowledge on data analysis, I can say am 60% empowered
- this training has broader my skill on use of data in problem solving as lots of insights are deduced from analysed datasets
- I will keep building on my  skills as I take on more projects.
